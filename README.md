# BeanGoTown

BeanGo Town is a game built on the AELF blockchain. Inspired by Monopoly. Users need to obtain the NFT to start the game. Click the GO button to roll the dice to determine the number of steps to move, and receive corresponding point rewards based on the location the piece lands on after the move.

- The game supports multiple ways to log in or register (Web2/Web3).
- The BeanPass NFT required to play the game can be collected directly in the game.
- The number of points rolled in the game is determined by random numbers generated on the chain.
